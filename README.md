"The gentle push from the ocean currents brings the graceful creature's attention back from gazing at the somber blue light wavering through the barrier of air and water. A sense of purpose renewed it dives deeper, and deeper still, until the inky dark envelopes and finally blinds. "

Moonfish is a haphazard, ill-planned, labourious journey into reverse engineering Halo 2—the hit video-game created by Bungie™ studios which I love dearly. I'd been drawn into modding the game while playing on the 'poor mans' version of Xbox LIVE: XBConnect. Hours of modded Tower of Power on Ascension with a group of awesome gamers every day for weeks characterized my teen years and would push me int ways I couldn't imagine.

It would be a year before I discovered Halomods; the ubiquitous modding website dedicated to this very same game. Spurred by an initial zealous enthusiasm I started experimenting with Dothalo, and eventually Entity: two high-profile programs in those days that could modify the binaries of the map files used by the Halo 2 game engine. I found a loved 'skinning' the levels to have new looks, and dabbled with making 3d-models for the game... but soon I would find myself hitting a wall: hard.

You see the tools in those times were clunky, hard, cudgels.

They simply were not very full featured, and more often than not left a map file so broken it lay weeping in a corner until you mercifully over-wrote it with a 'clean' map and began slicing away again. Charming.

So now I was faced with a problem: I wanted to do great things with Halo 2, I thought I could succeed too if only I had the right tools for the job. So I set out to make just that...

... to be continued another time.
